## Automated-Testing-Libraries
# Included in this repo is an automated testing library developed for the Luau language. 
- Inside of this project there is a TDD library (named "PenguinTest") and a BDD library (called PickleModule).
- Each library is self-verifying and has it's own meta test cases. 
- Additionally, there is also an example use case I've put inside of the repo, which demonstrates how the TDD module will be used.
