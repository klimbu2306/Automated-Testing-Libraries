# Penguin Test (TDD) + Pickle Module (BDD) Libraries
- Inside of this project there is a TDD library (named "PenguinTest") and a BDD library (called PickleModule). 
- Each library is self-verifying and has it's own meta test cases. 
- Additionally, there is also an example use case I've put inside of the repo, which demonstrates how the TDD module can be used in a scenario involving programming football physics.
